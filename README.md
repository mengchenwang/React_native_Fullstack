I completed this project as a week-long tech test in Jan 2018. Project includes a frontend mobile app for iOS, a backend server and a cloud database.

Mobile app will show a list view of contacts' names.

Tap on a contact's name will navigate to a details page to show the contact's photo, name, age, month & days till their next birthday and their rating.

Contact's rating can be changed by tapping the 'Edit' button and then tap on the '+' or '-' button. Tap on 'Save' will update the database with the new rating.
